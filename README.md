# Pluralsight Course - Doing Data Science with Python - Titanic Data Science Challenge
==============================

How to work on an end-to-end data science project including processing data, building & evaluating machine learning model, and exposing the model as an API in a standardized approach using various Python libraries.

# Extract

Extracting Titanic Disaster Data From Kaggle
Tested on:
- Python 3.7
- kaggle==1.5.6

Setup Kaggle API token

Steps:
- Go to the Account Tab ( https://www.kaggle.com/<username>/account ) and click Create API Token. A file named kaggle.json will be downloaded.
- place kaggle.json inside the root level titanic folder.
- make sure kaggle.json is an entry in the .gitignore file so that you accidently share the credentials
- install kaggle package using command: ``` pip install kaggle```
